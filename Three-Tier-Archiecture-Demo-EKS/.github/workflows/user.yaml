# Define the name of the workflow
name: User

# Define the events that trigger the workflow
on:
  # Trigger the workflow on push events to the master branch
  push:
    branches:
      - master
    # Only trigger the workflow on changes to JavaScript files and the workflow file itself
    paths:
      - '**.js'  # Note: The comment is incorrect, it mentions Python files (**.py) instead of JavaScript files
      - '.github/workflows/user.yaml'  # Include workflow file changes

  # Trigger the workflow on pull request events to the master branch
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - master
    # Only trigger the workflow on changes to JavaScript files and the workflow file itself
    paths:
      - '**.js'  # Note: The comment is incorrect, it mentions Python files (**.py) instead of JavaScript files
      - '.github/workflows/user.yaml'  # Include workflow file changes

# Define the jobs that run in the workflow
jobs:
  # Define a job named "payment" that builds and deploys the User microservice
  payment:
    # Name of the job
    name: Build and deploy user microservice
    # Run the job on a self-hosted runner
    runs-on: [self-hosted]  # Note: The comment suggests using a standard runner instead of self-hosted

    # Define the steps that run in the job
    steps:
      # Step 1: Checkout the code
      - name: Checkout code 
        # Use the actions/checkout action to checkout the code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
        # Fetch all commit history
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0

      # Step 2: Install dependencies using NPM
      - name: NPM install
        # Run the command to install dependencies
        run: npm install 

      # Step 3: Build the Docker image
      - name: Build Docker image
        # Run a command to build the Docker image
        run: |
          # Build the image tagged as 'user' from the current directory
          docker build -t user .  
          # Note: The comment mentions building an image tagged as 'payment', but the code builds an image tagged as 'user'

      # Step 4: Login to Docker Hub using secrets
      - name: Docker Login (use secrets)
        # Run a command to login to Docker Hub
        run: docker login -u ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_USERNAME }} -p ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_TOKEN }}

      # Step 5: Push the Docker image
      - name: Docker Push
        # Run commands to push the Docker image
        run: |
          # Tag the image with the username and latest tag
          docker tag user ${name}/user:latest
          # Push the image to Docker Hub
          # Note: The command 'docker user' is incorrect, it should be 'docker push' instead
          docker push ${name}/user:latest

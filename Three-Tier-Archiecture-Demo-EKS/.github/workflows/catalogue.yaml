    name: Build and deploy catalogue microservice
    # Run the job on a self-hosted runner
    runs-on: [self-hosted]  # Note: The comment suggests using a standard runner instead of self-hosted

    # Define the steps that run in the job
    steps:
      # Step 1: Checkout the code
      - name: Checkout code 
        # Use the actions/checkout action to checkout the code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
        # Fetch all commit history
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0

      # Step 2: Install dependencies using NPM
      - name: NPM install
        # Run the command to install dependencies
        run: npm install 

      # Step 3: Build the Docker image
      - name: Build Docker image
        # Run the command to build the Docker image
        run: |
          # Build the image tagged as 'catalogue' from the current directory
          docker build -t catalogue .  

      # Step 4: Login to Docker Hub using secrets
      - name: Docker Login (use secrets)
        # Run the command to login to Docker Hub
        run: docker login -u ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_USERNAME }} -p ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_TOKEN }}

      # Step 5: Push the Docker image
      - name: Docker Push
        # Run the commands to push the Docker image
        run: |
          # Tag the image with the username and latest tag
          docker tag catalogue ${name}/catalogue:latest
          # Push the image to Docker Hub
          # Note: There is an error in this command, it should be 'docker push' instead of 'docker catalogue'
          docker push ${name}/catalogue:latest
